# Challenges in deep learning optimization

Machine learning has avoided the difficulty of general optimization by carefully designing the objective function and constraints to ensure that the optimization problem is convex. Training neural networks usually confront the non-convex case.

## Ill-conditioning

## Local minima

## Plateaus, saddle points, and flat regions

## Cliffs and exploding gradients

## Long-term dependencies

## Inexact gradients

## Poor correspondence between local and global structure

## Theoretical limits of optimization
