Examples 
=============

This section contains examples of how to use the library.

- `How to use benchmark functions <notebooks/1.setup_functions.ipynb>`_
- `How to optimize a function <notebooks/2.optimize_a_function.ipynb>`_
- `How to create a dashboard for optimizations <notebooks/3.optymus_dashboard.ipynb>`_
- `Methods comparison <notebooks/4.methods_comparison.ipynb>`_
- `Visualization with PCA <notebooks/5.visualization_with_pca.ipynb>`_
- `Constraint optimization <notebooks/6.constraint_optimization.ipynb>`_

Some applications are:
