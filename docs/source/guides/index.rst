This guide provide some theoretical backgound on optimization methods. With this you can understand how the optimization methods work and how to use them in the `optymus` module.

We focus on continuous optimization. The continuous optimization methods are used to optimize functions with continuous variables like problems with real numbers, vectors, etc.
