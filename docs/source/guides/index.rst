This guide provide some theoretical backgound on optimization methods. With this you can understand how the optimization methods work and how to use them in the `optymus` module.

We focus on two types of optimization methods: continuous optimization and discrete optimization. The continuous optimization methods are used to optimize functions with continuous variables like problems with real numbers, vectors, etc. The discrete optimization methods are used to optimize functions with discrete variables like problems with integers, binary variables, etc.
